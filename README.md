# Automobile Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project performs a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an automobile dataset. The goal is to clean, analyze, and visualize the data to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights that can inform further analysis or predictive modeling.

The analysis includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, converting data types, generating summary statistics, and creating visualizations to explore the relationships between features.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**
  - Replace missing values represented by `'?'` with `NaN`.
  - Drop rows containing null values.
  - Remove duplicate rows.
  - Convert columns to appropriate numeric data types for accurate analysis.

- **Summary Statistics**
  - Overview of numeric features with mean, median, min, max, standard deviation, and more.
  - Identification of key statistics for price, horsepower, engine size, and other features.

- **Visualizations**
  - **Correlation Heatmap:** Shows relationships between numeric features.
  - **Price Distribution:** Histogram with kernel density estimate for car prices.
  - **Price vs. Horsepower:** Scatter plot to analyze the effect of horsepower on price.
  - **Body Style vs. Price:** Boxplot to compare prices across different car body styles.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
```

2. Ensure your dataset CSV file is in the project directory and update the file path in the code:

```python
df = pd.read_csv("your_file.csv")
```

3. Run the Python script:

```bash
python automobile_eda.py
```

4. The script will:

   * Clean the dataset.
   * Display summary statistics.
   * Generate visualizations to explore feature relationships.

## Insights

* Provides a clear understanding of the distribution of car prices.
* Identifies correlations between numeric features such as horsepower, engine size, and price.
* Highlights price differences across car body styles.
* Serves as a foundation for further analysis or machine learning tasks.
